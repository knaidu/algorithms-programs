# algorithms-programs

Hi. This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Its a repository of algorithms and programs that I come across including interview questions, programing puzzles, math questions etc.

## The design

This is a fork of holman.github.com, all html, css, look and feel belongs to him. I'll eventually get around to tweaking it to my taste, but first things first - algorithms practice.
